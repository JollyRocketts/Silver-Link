## Introduction
With retirement often marking a significant transition in one's
life, many elderly individuals find themselves longing for opportunities to remain active,
socially connected, and financially independent.
Traditional retirement often leads to a loss of routine, purpose, and social interaction,
which can contribute to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and diminished self-worth.
Moreover, while some retirees may have the desire and capability to continue working in
some capacity, they are often overlooked or limited by physical constraints and
age-related biases in the job market.
Recognizing these challenges, the SilverLink App seeks to empower retired individuals
by connecting them with suitable job opportunities and fostering social connections. We
aim to make retirement more enjoyable by keeping retirees active, social, and healthy.
